# 3. Resource Groups (Sub-Containers)

What it is: Inside each subscription, you can have resource groups. These are containers that hold related resources.

Purpose: They help organize resources based on their lifecycle and permissions. All the resources in a group are usually related to the same project or service.

Example: If you're building a web app, you might have a resource group called "rg-ohg365-dev" where you store everything related to the app, such as databases, storage accounts, and virtual machines.
