# 2.1 What is a Resource Group?

A Resource Group in Azure is like a folder that holds all the resources (services) related to a project or app.

For example:If you build a website, you might have:

### A Virtual Machine (VM) for the web server

### A Storage Account for images

### A Database for user data

You can put all of these inside one Resource Group — making it easier to manage, monitor, and delete them together.
