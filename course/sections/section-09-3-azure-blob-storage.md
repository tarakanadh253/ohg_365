# 3. Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft’s cloud-based service designed to store large amounts of data of various types — including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

It is ideal for storing files such as CSV, text, Excel, JSON, Parquet, Avro, XML, images, videos, backups, and logs.

The term “Blob” stands for Binary Large Object, meaning it can store any type of binary data. Blob Storage provides a flat namespace, meaning all files (blobs) are stored in containers within a storage account, rather than in a traditional hierarchical folder system.

Azure Blob Storage is highly scalable, secure, and cost-efficient, making it suitable for:

Storing and serving large files (media, documents, etc.)

Data lakes and analytics workloads

Backup and disaster recovery

Archiving and compliance storage
