MEDICAL CODING ABHISHEK-CPC
Medical coding is a translation or conversion of diseases or
conditions, procedures or surgeries, and materials or supplies in to
universally accepted codes.
Ex: for diseases are: Appendicitis, Fever, Rhinitis, Nephritis, HIV,
Sepsis etc.
EX: for procedures are: Appendectomy, Rhinotomy, x- ray, MRI,
Anaesthesia etc.

--- PAGE 2 ---
EX: Materials: Ambulance services, wheelchair equipment’s,
Bandages, injections, Durable medical equipment.
CODES: 3 TYPES
Alphabetical, Numeric, Alpha+numeric.
Numeric: only numbers
Alphanumeric: alphabets+ numbers
Alphabetical: only alphabets.

RCM CYCLE (REVENUE CYCLE MANAGEMENT)
Patients come to hospital with disease, physician provides treatment
to patient, insurance company pays fees for physician, patient pays
premium to the insurance company.
Medical Transcript: Translates the Audio file in to Text file.
Medical coder: Converts the Text file in to Coding file.
Medical Biller: Converts coding file in to billing form.
BOOKS USED IN MEDICAL CODING ARE:

--- PAGE 4 ---
ICD–10–CM: International classification of diseases 10th Revision
clinical modification.
• This book published by WHO.
• This book is used for to code Diseases.
• They are 3 – 7 digits, Alpha+ numeric codes.
CPT: Current procedural terminology
• Published by American medical association.
• This book is used for to code procedure or surgeries or services.
• They are 5-digit numeric codes
HCPCS: Health care common procedural coding system.
• Published by CMS (centre for Medicare and Medicaid services)
• This book is used to code the supplies or material codes.
• This book contains 5-digit alpha + numeric codes
CPC – CERTIFICATION:
• Certified professional coder exam conducted by AAPC.
• 100 – marks exam 70% is qualifying percentage.
• 4 hours exam Duration.
• Open Book Exam ICD-10-CM, CPT, HCPCS.
CARRER IN MEDICAL CODING:
• We start our career as Junior medical coder then senior medical
coder followed by Team leader and asst manager then manager.
• Packages depend on the companies.
• Cpc certified paid more than non-cerfier.

ANATOMY AND MEDICAL TERMINOLGY
Anatomy and medical terminology are most important for medical coding.
• To read the patient report we should know the medical terms and
anatomical structure and function of the organ.
• Medical terms: medical terms are a language of medicine used to
describe the anatomical structures or organ names, disease names and
procedures.
Ex1: medical terms for organs are
➢ Dermo = Skin
➢ Cardio = Heart
➢ Dento = Teeth
Ex2: Medical terms for diseases are
➢ Itis = inflammation or infection
➢ Gastritis = inflammation of stomach
➢ Dermatitis = inflammation of skin
Ex 3: medical terms for surgeries or procedure are
➢ Ectomy = surgical removal
➢ Otomy = surgical incision

--- PAGE 6 ---
➢ Scopy = visual examination
➢ Appendectomy = surgical removal of appendix
➢ Gatroscopy = visual examination of stomach.
➢ Dematotomy = surgical incision of skin.
ANATOMY: Branch of science concerned with bodily structures of humans and
other living organisms.
CELL: Structural and functional unit of the body or organism.
• Group of cells forms tissues
• Group of tissues forms organs
• Group of organs forms organ system
• Group of organ systems forms human body.
To form human body there is a need of 11 systems.
1) Integumentary system (skin, nails, hair)

--- PAGE 7 ---
2) Muscular system (muscles)
3) Skeletal system (bones)
4) Nervous system (brain, spinal cord)
5) Endocrine system (Glands)
6) Respiratory system (lungs)
7) Digestive system (mouth, stomach, intestine etc)
8) Cardiovascular system (Heart, blood vessels)
9) Renal system (kidney, urinary bladder etc)
10) Reproductive system
➢ Male reproductive system
➢ Female reproductive system
11) Lymphatic system (immune system)

--- PAGE 8 ---
A we start the training from basics like medical terms and entire 11 systems of
anatomy
➢ If your is non – life science graduate also u can crack the CPC exam and
interview if u know the basics like medical terms, anatomy and
guidelines.

MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY
Medical term contains 4 parts.
Prefix: Starting of medical term and it Changes the entire meaning of the
medical term.
Example: PHAGIA means Swallowing.
➢ Euphagia = normal swallowing.
➢ Dysphagia = difficulty in swallowing.
➢ Aphagia = absence of swallowing.
ROOT WORD: Root word is a foundation of medical term Generally it is a name
of the organ and it is noun.
EXAMPLE:
• Gastr = stomach
• Cardi = heart
• Hepat = liver
• Enter = small intestine.
• Col = large intestine.
COMBINING VOWEL: (a, e, i, o, u): combining vowel which combines the
ROOT WORD+ ROOT WORD and ROOT WORD + SUFFIX.
EXAMPLE: GASTROENTEROLOGY = Here O is the combining vowel which
combining Root word + Root word.
Second O combining the Root word + suffix (logy)
2) GASTROLOGY: Here O combining the Root word + suffix.
NOTE: when suffix starts with vowel, we should not use another vowel.
Example: GASTRITIS = here ITIS means inflammation and (I) is the vowel and

--- PAGE 9 ---
suffix is starting with the vowel we are not using another vowel.
SUFFIX: Suffix is the ending of the medical term and it changes the entire
meaning of the medical term.
Example: logy = study of, Itis = inflammation, Magaly = enlargement.
• GASTROLOGY = Study of stomach.
• GASTRITIS = Inflammation of stomach
• GASTROMEGALY = Enlargement of stomach.

• Major organs present in Pelvic cavity are – URINARY BLADDER, UTERUS,
FALLOPIAN TUBES, OVARIES ETC. -
5) SYNOVIAL CAVITY: the space present between two bones is called synovial
cavity.
• Synovial cavity contains synovial fluid which prevent friction between
two bones
